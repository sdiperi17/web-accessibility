                            Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the mystical story
                            of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns
                            to travel in search of a worldly treasure. His quest
                            will lead him to riches far different—and far more
                            satisfying—than he ever imagined. Santiago's journey
                            teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening
                            to our hearts, of recognizing opportunity and
                            learning to read the omens strewn along life's path,
                            and, most importantly, to follow our dreams.

                            Santiago is a shepherd. He loves his flock, though
                            he can’t help but notice the limited nature of the
                            sheep’s existence. Seeking only food and water, they
                            never lift their heads to admire the green hills or
                            the sunsets. Santiago’s parents have continually
                            struggled for the basics of life and have smothered
                            their own ambitions accordingly. They live in
                            beautiful Andalucía, which attracts tourists to its
                            quaint villages and rolling hills, but for them it
                            is not a place of dreams.

                            Santiago, on the other hand, can read and wants to
                            travel. He goes into town one day to sell some of
                            his flock and encounters a tramp-king and a gypsy
                            woman. They urge him to ‘follow his omens’ and leave
                            the world he knows. The gypsy points him toward the
                            pyramids of Egypt, where she says he will find
                            treasure.

                            Much of self-help literature is about pursuing our
                            destiny, but dreams do not always pull us along;
                            they speak persistently but quietly, and it does not
                            take much effort to smother the inner voices. Who is
                            willing to risk comfort, routine, security and
                            existing relationships to follow something that to
                            others looks like a mirage? It takes courage, and
                            dog-eared, stained copies of Coelho’s classic have
                            become the constant companion of people who need to
                            make fearless decisions daily to keep true to a
                            larger vision.
